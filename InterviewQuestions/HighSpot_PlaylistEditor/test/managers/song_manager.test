- song Manager constructor accepts an array of songs
- an instantiated song manager can have its internal array of songs returned
- a song_manager.get will return nil if no user in the array has an id matching the one passed
- a song_manager.get will return the song if one has an id matching the one passed in
- a song manager.add will add the song to the collection and return the new song (with id)
- a song manager.add should have a graceful failure state with bad input #NOT IMPLEMENTED
